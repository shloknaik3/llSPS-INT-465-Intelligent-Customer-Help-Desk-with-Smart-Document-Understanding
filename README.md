Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

This project is a part of the internship in partnership with SmartBridge - SmartInternz program. In this project, we will create an Intelligent Customer Help Desk with smart Document Understanding. A chatbot usually faces the problem of confusion in replying when posed with a question out of it's pre-defined database of queries. It will then propose to forward the customer's query to a human correspondent.
An intelligent chatbot instead will be able to give answers for the customer's queries by referring to a smartly documented manual of the product and there would be no need for human intervention. This project aims to create such an intelligent chatbot engine.
